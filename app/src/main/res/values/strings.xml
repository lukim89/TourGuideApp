Nowadays, the castle houses collections of the Bielsko-Biała Museum. During the visit to the castle we can experience the past elegance and learn more about the history of the city, admiring old and contemporary art, and even listen to good music.</string>

    <string name="old_factory_description">The museum was opened in the former cloth factory of Karol Büttner. Machines and equipment were collected on two floors of a historic factory building. In the spinning mill, preliminary treatment mill, weaving mill and finishing shop rooms visitors learn about the production cycle of wool fabrics. Machines for the hat production form a separate unit. Displays on the history of local fire-brigade and waterworks, a little printing house and a place where household appliances are collected supplement the exhibition. For centuries the sister towns - Silesian Bielsko and Biała from Lesser Poland, united 59 years ago - belonged to the most important textile hubs in our part of Europe. Bringing of mechanical spinning frames, application of a steam machine and opening of the first comprehensive cloth factories marked further stages of the industrialization process. In the interwar period, the twin city was referred to as Silesian Manchester, and the brand “wool of Bielsko” was known all around the world. Some buildings of the former cloth factory of the Büttner family form today the Old Factory - department of the Historical Museum in Bielsko - Biała.</string>

    <string name="weaver_house_description">The Weaver’s House – an outside exhibition of the Historical Museum in Bielsko-Biala – is located in the area of the Upper Suburb (Górne Przemieście) dating back to the first half of the 15th century and inhabited by clothiers from Bielsko. The traditions of the house, which now accommodates the museum, go back to the 18th century. There used to be a clothier’s flat and workshop until the beginning of the 20th century, but there is no detailed information about other tenants. In the second half of the 18th century there must have lived the Bartke family and in the 19th century, the Batheltowie family. Since 1873 the building was owned by Carl Nowak, and after his death, by his widowed wife, Marie. At the beginning of the 20th century there was a workshop of a shoemaker, Antoni Polończyk, which remained there until the Second World War. In the postwar period the building was a normal tenement house. Antoni’s son – Wiktor Polończyk – donated the house to the State Treasury in 1974 with the purpose of creating a museum. Following long-term maintenance and reconstruction works, in 1992 the museum was opened to the public.</string>
